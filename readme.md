# Streaming Blacklist - Backend

## Overview

This repository contains the backend code for my Streaming Blacklist project. The backend is built using Express, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It leverages the power of Express to handle routing, middleware, and API endpoints effectively. The backend communicates with a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve user and media information. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication and authorization.
